## FAQ

**Why do this?**

> No specific reason.  I used to have a Python tool called [unp](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/unp)
> which just shells out to system tools to unpack and I felt like I want to see if I can use the
> rust ecosystem to build one that comes with the unpacking code.

**How fast is it?**

> It's not particularly fast.  In fact it's about 50% slower than the system tools but for most
> archives I unpack that does not cause me any grief.
